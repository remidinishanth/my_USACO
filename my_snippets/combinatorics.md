## Enumerative combinatorics

### Catalan numbers
The Catalan numbers are a remarkable sequence of numbers that “solve” a number of seemingly unrelated counting problems. 

* **Triangulation of polygon:** A convex `(n+2)`-gon can be split into `n` triangles by `n-1` non-intersecting diagonals. The number of different ways of splitting is given by catalan number Cn. \
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19663316/121805524-3f443880-cc69-11eb-88a5-3ae9587e94d1.png)\
 Proof: Given `(n+2)-gon`, say we consider the base of the polygon and number vertices from `1` to `n`. Suppose that the third vertex of the base triangle is `k`, the green polygon is `k+1`-gon and the red polygon is `n+k-2`-gon, then we get the following recurrence relation.\

* **Casheir Problem:** Cn is the number of ways to form a "mountain range" with n upstrokes and n downstrokes that all stay above a horizontal line. The mountain range interpretation is that the mountains will never go below the horizon. For `n = 3`  `Cn = 5`.\
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19663316/121807707-e6799d80-cc72-11eb-8f5b-d4024f185e7d.png)
  Say in a country we only have 2 coin denominations `5` and `10`. Now suppose that we have `2n` people in a line waiting to buy a movie ticket, `n` of them are having `5` rupees and the other `n` are having `10` rupees and the cashier has no change. How many different ways are possible such that ticket seller is always able to satisfy all the people. If we consider `5` as `+1` and `10` as `-1` then for the people in the line, the prefix sum should always be `>= 0`. If we consider `5` as moving 1 unit in x direction and `10` and moving 1 unit in y direction. We should never touch the line `y = x + 1`.

  The number of invalid paths can be calculated Andre's reflection principle. Andre's Reflection Principle: A path is invalid if it touches or crosses the line `y = x + 1`. In any case it touches the line the first time at let's say 𝑃. Now, we reflect the first part of the path from 𝐴=(0,0) to 𝑃 at the line `y = x + 1` getting a path from `A′=(−1,1)`. So the total valid paths = `[All paths from (0, 0) to (n, n)]` - `[All paths from (-1, 1) to (n, n)]`. `[All paths from (0, 0) to (n, n)]` = `[number of ways of arranging n A's and n B's = (2n choose n)]`\

  Similarly if cashier initally has `k` 5 rupee denominations then the diagonal moves up `k` units and we can use reflection priniciple.
  
  **Bertrand's ballot problem** is the question: "In an election where candidate A receives p votes and candidate B receives q votes with p > q, what is the probability that A will be strictly ahead of B throughout the count?" The answer is  (p - q)/(p + q). The number of favourable ways `(p+q-1 choose p-1)` - `(p+q-1 choose p)`. Proof: First vote should always go to candidate A, now we are left with `(p-1)` A's votes and `q` B's votes and now ties are allowed, so by reflection trick we get `(p+q-1 choose p-1)` - `(p+q-1 choose p)`. If ties are allowed in the original problem then the answer would be `(p+q choose q) - (p+q choose q-1)`.

#### ABC 209 Problem C - Not Equal
You are given a sequence C of N integers. Find the number of sequences A of N integers satisfying all of the following conditions. `1 ≤ Aᵢ ≤ Cᵢ ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N )` Aᵢ ≠ Aⱼ ( 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N ) Since the count may be enormous, print it modulo (10⁹ + 7).

Solution: Sort `Cᵢ` in increasing order and Now for each of the index `i` we have `max(0, Cᵢ - (i-1))` choices to choose the element. We can prove this because, after determining the first i − 1 elements `A₁ , A₂ , … ,` the candidates for `Aᵢ` are `1 , 2 , … Cᵢ` , except for `A₁ , A₂ , … Aᵢ − 1` (which are all pairwise distinct and between `1` and `Cᵢ` , inclusive); namely there are `(Cᵢ − i + 1)` candidates. If however any i satisfies `Cᵢ − i + 1 < 0`, then the answer is 0 .

#### Leetcode Paiting a grid with 3 different colors

Painting a `m * n` grid with three different colors such that no two adjacent cells have same color, Here `1 <= m <= 5 & 1 <= n <= 1000` since `m` is very small we can create a graph where each node denotes a column `(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5)` and count the number of columns compatible with this using dynamic programming.

Number of Integer solutions for the equation `x1 + x2 + ... + xr = n` and  `x >= 0` is `C(n+r-1, r-1)`.

Proof: We can assume we want to arrange (r-1) `+` symbols and (n) `1`'s so it is `(n-r+1)!/(n! (r-1)!)`.

If we want solutions such that `x > 0`, then it is arranging (r-1) `+` symbols into gaps of n `1`'s that is `1 x 1 x 1 .. x 1` we need to choose (r-1) x positions out of the available `(n-1)` positions and hence we have `C(n-1, r-1)`

#### Colorful Hats 2

N people are standing in a queue, numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , N from front to back. Each person wears a hat, which is red, blue, or green. 

The person numbered i says: "In front of me, exactly Ai people are wearing hats with the same color as mine." 

Assuming that all these statements are correct, find the number of possible combinations of colors of the N people's hats. Since the count can be enormous, compute it modulo 1000000007 .
