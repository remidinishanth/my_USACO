## Flow Graph Modeling

* Recognizing that the problem is indeed a Network Flow problem(this will get better after you solve more Network Flow problems).
* Constructing the appropriate flow graph (i.e. if using our code shown earlier: Initiate the residual matrix res and set the appropriate values for ‘s’ and ‘t’).
* Running the Edmonds Karp’s code on this flow graph.


### Bipartite matching

### Disjoint paths

Many graph problems can be solved by reducing them to the maximum flow
problem. Our first example of such a problem is as follows: we are given a
directed graph with a source and a sink, and our task is to find the maximum
number of disjoint paths from the source to the sink.
