# Centroid Decomposition

## Task

Given a tree, we are asked to find all the number of pairs `(u, v)` such that `dist(u, v) ≤ D`.

We can use Centroid decomposition technique to solve this problem. Centroid Decomposition is just a divide and conquer technique which is used on trees and turns out useful in many problems.
